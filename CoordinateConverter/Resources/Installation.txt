1. Add the CoordinateConverter.lua file to "Saved Games/DCS/Scripts/"
2. Add this line to "Saved Games/DCS/Scripts/Export.lua"

local CCLfs=require('lfs'); dofile(CCLfs.writedir()..'Scripts/CoordinateConverter.lua')

If "Saved Games/DCS/Scripts/Export.lua" does not exist, create it and add that single line into it.
