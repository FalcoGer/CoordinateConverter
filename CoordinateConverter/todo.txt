STOP FUNCTION
put ah64 plt/cpg into it's own menu strip
    - put clear points into that same menu only once
    - clear points form with point type, start index and end index (numeric up down controls)
        - CMs start at 50 and go to 99
fix unit import
    - make clicking object Id copy the data to clipboard
Re-add multi select to main data grid view to de/reselect many points at once
Re-add sorting by header for rapid selection
Add multi delete without deleting all/singles
When saving/loading, update the default location and file name
     - add a save option that just overwrites the last file loaded/saved
Add input for how many points to be deleted for AH64 clear points
Add support for selection instead of camera position when something is selected
    - add option for auto listing any new unit that was clicked
        - alternatively use LoGetWorldObjects("units") (Exports.lua:L426)
            - calculate every unit's distance from the camera ground position, if within a margin, add that unit if it isn't already in the list
            - exclude air units
            - use camera altitude (not ground elevation) to determine the margin
    - find out how to do that in lua
        - check in DCS World install dir in `\Scripts\Export.lua` for clues
        - LoGetObjectById()
            - how to get ID?
Add support for importing airfields
     - LoGetWorldObjects("airdromes") (Exports.lua:L426)
    - create coordinate data entries for each unit to import.
        - add the appropriate ah64 specific data for each unit type
        - use the dcs encyclopedia data to figure out categories for unknown types
        - load type database from external file?
            - tool to create/edit that file?
Add aircraft support (https://github.com/aronCiucu/DCSTheWay/tree/main/src/moduleCommands)
    - general
        - determine keycodes with `Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\<type>\Cockpit\Scripts\clickabledata.lua`
        - determine device ids with `Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\<type>\Cockpit\Scripts\devices.lua`
    - F18
        - fetch if precise is selected (https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/2ao01d/so_apparently_there_was_a_way_to_get_the_text_of/)
            - might be impossible, this is 9 years old
        - if not possible use LoSetSharedTexture (Export.lua L1061) and analyze bitmap (?)
            - test with multiple resolutions
        - SLAM-ER (point type: SLAM-ER Station (how to differenciate?)) -> point options: (WP1 .. 5)
        - tune speed
        - hornet, autoswitch all to PP2 after dropping from BRU?
    - A10C
        - remind user that selection MGRS will use MGRS input into CDU
            -fetch if UTM or L/L is selected (https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/2ao01d/so_apparently_there_was_a_way_to_get_the_text_of/)
                - might be impossible, this is 9 years old
                - if not possible use LoSetSharedTexture (Export.lua L1061) and analyze bitmap (?)
                    - test with multiple resolutions
        - make sure waypoints with the same names get numbered
        - make sure that waypoint max name length is 12, even with the extra numbering
        - maybe needs `LoGetRoute()` 
    - F15E
        - Ask user for seat
    - JF17 (?)
    - KA-50
        - Point types as per PVI-800
            - need to remember next point id for each type to press the correct button
    - F16
        - JDAM options(?) in DED?
add checkbox option for camera altitude/ground altitude in status bar
Allow users to do tedious setups, perhaps save a sequence of commands to be played back later (low priority)
    - Include DTC features, separate from points entirely
        - saving/loading for each aircraft type
        - comms plan
            - check on how srs determines currently selected channel id/frequency/guard receiver status
        - iff plan
            - check on how SRS/LotATC determine transponder status and codes
        - countermeasure settings
            - LoGetSnares() -- count only
            - find out how to get current programming
                - may need display text export (https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/2ao01d/so_apparently_there_was_a_way_to_get_the_text_of/)
                    - may not work, maybe needs texture export and OCR
        - D/L
        - TACAN
        - ILS
Make pressing N/S/E/W keys in the L/L textboxes switch the RB (on text change to allow pasting)
    - hitting the button should also switch to the next text box
make hitting the character limit in UTM and MGRS text boxes switch to the next text box
next waypoint bearing/range/deltaAltitude column
