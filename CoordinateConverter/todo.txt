Connection to DCS asyncronous to prevent ui freezes.
When saving/loading, update the default location and file name
     - add a save option that just overwrites the last file loaded/saved
Make helper form for F10 selection
     - transparent background
     - no decorations
     - always on top
     - not movable
         - make screen selector (menu strip populated by screen count?)
     - autoshow on F10? (determine F10 by camera rotation, straight down and facing north)
On lua error (pcall), also set the response error message for faster error detection
replace progress bar from time based to actual button press based
     - add current key index field to dcs message
     - add key index as status if busy
     - remove total delay return from send commands function and return number of commands instead, adjust all caller sites
Add support for selection instead of camera position when something is selected
     - add option for auto listing any new unit that was clicked
         - alternatively use LoGetWorldObjects("units") (Exports.lua:L426)
             - calculate every unit's distance from the camera ground position, if within a margin, add that unit if it isn't already in the list
             - exclude air units
             - use camera altitude (not ground elevation) to determine the margin
     - find out how to do that in lua
         - check in DCS World install dir in `\Scripts\Export.lua` for clues
         - LoGetObjectById()
             - how to get ID?
Add support for importing airfields
     - LoGetWorldObjects("airdromes") (Exports.lua:L426)
Add aircraft support (https://github.com/aronCiucu/DCSTheWay/tree/main/src/moduleCommands)
     - general
         - determine keycodes with `Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\<type>\Cockpit\Scripts\clickabledata.lua`
         - determine device ids with `Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\<type>\Cockpit\Scripts\devices.lua`
     - F18
         - remind user to select precise
             - fetch if precise is selected (https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/2ao01d/so_apparently_there_was_a_way_to_get_the_text_of/)
                 - might be impossible, this is 9 years old
                 - if not possible use LoSetSharedTexture (Export.lua L1061) and analyze bitmap (?)
                     - test with multiple resolutions
         - get current waypoint/route info with `LoGetRoute()`, append new inserts after last.
              - may be 60 points of all 0, check lua output
              - check if markpoints changes things
         - might be possible to get selected station. See `LoGetPayloadInfo()` in DCS World install dir in `\Scripts\Export.lua` L552
               ```text
               LoGetPayloadInfo() -- return weapon stations
               result_of_LoGetPayloadInfo 
               {
               	CurrentStation = , -- number of current station (0 if no station selected)
               	Stations = {},-- table of stations
               	Cannon =
               	{
               		shells -- current shells count 
               	}
               }
               station 
               {
               	container = true/false , -- is station container
               	weapon    = {level1,level2,level3,level4} , -- world database classification of weapon
               	count = ,
               }
               ```
         - ask users for weapon stations and types. programmable types:
             - jdam/jsow (point type: GPS Weapon Pre Plan (current station/next station) -> point options: pp1 .. pp5
             - SLAM (?)
             - SLAM-ER (point type: SLAM-ER Station (how to differenciate?)) -> point options: (WP1 .. 5)
             - harpoon (point type: harpoon) -> point options: (only "TurnPoint x (1..4) times")
                - IMPORTANT: waypoint will have to be entered first to ensure HSI waypoint data is set up to select the HPTP from the HSI selection
                - explain to the user that specific harpoon stations can't be programmed and that the currently selected harpoon and any subsequent ones will be altered
                - special case, next point is target point if exists. get bra and range and display that info in data grid
                     - set that up as search range and destruct range +/- 15nmi (?)
     - A10C
         - remind user that selection MGRS will use MGRS input into CDU
             -fetch if UTM or L/L is selected (https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/2ao01d/so_apparently_there_was_a_way_to_get_the_text_of/)
                 - might be impossible, this is 9 years old
                 - if not possible use LoSetSharedTexture (Export.lua L1061) and analyze bitmap (?)
                     - test with multiple resolutions
         - make sure waypoints with the same names get numbered
         - make sure that waypoint max name length is 12, even with the extra numbering
         - maybe needs `LoGetRoute()` 
     - F15E
         - Ask user for seat
     - JF17 (?)
     - KA-50
         - Point types as per PVI-800
             - need to remember next point id for each type to press the correct button
     - F16
         - JDAM options(?)
add checkbox option for camera altitude/ground altitude in status bar
Allow users to do tedious setups, perhaps save a sequence of commands to be played back later
Make pressing N/S/E/W keys in the L/L textboxes switch the RB (on text change to allow pasting)
     - hitting the button should also switch to the next text box
make hitting the character limit in UTM and MGRS text boxes switch to the next text box
next waypoint bearing/range/deltaAltitude column
