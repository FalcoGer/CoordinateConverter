Add support for remote (DCS) hosts
    - auto switch reticle to never if ip is not localhost, because that makes no sense.


Make DataGridView faster
    - switch main form data grid to use a datatable (copy from unit importer)


rewrite networking
    - one stable connection, not constant connecting and disconnecting
    - lua should connect to the tool, not the tool to lua
        - prevents tool to hang without connections
        - binary property to check if connected before sending a message
    - lua creates socket in init
    - lua checks for connection every tick before trying to send/receive
    - lua autosends coordinates (?)
        - callback/delegate on data received?
        - async receiver
    - lua makes connection every x (3?) seconds using the timed export function if connection is not already established
        - dcs lag?
            - if so, how to make async?


When saving/loading, update the default location and file name
     - add a save option that just overwrites the last file loaded/saved


Add support for selection instead of camera position when something is selected
    - add option for auto listing any new unit that was clicked
        - alternatively use LoGetWorldObjects("units") (Exports.lua:L426)
            - calculate every unit's distance from the camera ground position, if within a margin, add that unit if it isn't already in the list
            - exclude air units
            - use camera altitude (not ground elevation) to determine the margin
    - find out how to do that in lua
        - check in DCS World install dir in `\Scripts\Export.lua` for clues
        - LoGetObjectById()
            - how to get ID?


Add support for importing airfields
    - LoGetWorldObjects("airdromes") (Exports.lua:L426)
    - create coordinate data entries for each unit to import.
        - add the appropriate ah64 specific data for each unit type
        - use the dcs encyclopedia data to figure out categories for unknown types
        - load type database from external file?
            - tool to create/edit that file?


Add aircraft support (https://github.com/aronCiucu/DCSTheWay/tree/main/src/moduleCommands)
    - general
        - determine keycodes with `Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\<type>\Cockpit\Scripts\clickabledata.lua`
        - determine device ids with `Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\<type>\Cockpit\Scripts\devices.lua`
    - F18
        - fetch if precise is selected (https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/2ao01d/so_apparently_there_was_a_way_to_get_the_text_of/)
            - might be impossible, this is 9 years old
        - if not possible use LoSetSharedTexture (Export.lua L1061) and analyze bitmap (?)
            - test with multiple resolutions
        - SLAM-ER
            - STP for each station?
        - hornet, autoswitch all to PP2 after dropping from BRU?
        - autoswitch to A/G or NAV mode before anything else because A/A mode will break things.
        - switch back to PP1 after entering any pre plan other than 1
    - A10C
        - remind user that selection MGRS will use MGRS input into CDU
            -fetch if UTM or L/L is selected (https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/2ao01d/so_apparently_there_was_a_way_to_get_the_text_of/)
                - might be impossible, this is 9 years old
                - if not possible use LoSetSharedTexture (Export.lua L1061) and analyze bitmap (?)
                    - test with multiple resolutions
        - make sure waypoints with the same names get numbered
        - make sure that waypoint max name length is 12, even with the extra numbering
        - maybe needs `LoGetRoute()` 
    - F15E
        - Ask user for seat
    - JF17
        - Check of N/S and E/W is automatically set and what the source of that information is


Allow users to do tedious setups, perhaps save a sequence of commands to be played back later (low priority)
    - Include DTC features, separate from points entirely
        - saving/loading for each aircraft type
        - comms plan
            - check on how srs determines currently selected channel id/frequency/guard receiver status
        - iff plan
            - check on how SRS/LotATC determine transponder status and codes
        - countermeasure settings
            - LoGetSnares() -- count only
            - find out how to get current programming
                - may need display text export (https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/2ao01d/so_apparently_there_was_a_way_to_get_the_text_of/)
                    - may not work, maybe needs texture export and OCR
        - D/L
        - TACAN
        - ILS


next waypoint bearing/range/deltaAltitude column
