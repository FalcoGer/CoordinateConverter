Connection to DCS asyncronous to prevent ui freezes.
When saving/loading, update the default location and file name
     - add a save option that just overwrites the last file loaded/saved
Make helper form for F10 selection
     - transparent background
     - no decorations
     - always on top
     - not movable
         - make screen selector (menu strip populated by screen count?)
On lua error (pcall), also set the response error message for faster error detection
replace progress bar from time based to actual button press based
     - add current key index field to dcs message
     - add key index as status if busy
     - remove total delay return from send commands function and return number of commands instead, adjust all caller sites
Add aircraft support (https://github.com/aronCiucu/DCSTheWay/tree/main/src/moduleCommands)
     - general
         - determine keycodes with `Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\<type>\Cockpit\Scripts\clickabledata.lua`
         - determine device ids with `Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\<type>\Cockpit\Scripts\devices.lua`
     - F18
         - remind user to select precise
             - fetch if precise is selected (https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/2ao01d/so_apparently_there_was_a_way_to_get_the_text_of/)
                 - might be impossible, this is 9 years old
         - ask users for weapon stations and types. programmable types:
             - jdam/jsow (point type: GPS Weapon Pre Plan (current station/next station) -> point options: pp1 .. pp5
             - SLAM (?)
             - SLAM-ER (point type: SLAM-ER Station (how to differenciate?)) -> point options: (WP1 .. 5)
             - harpoon (point type: harpoon) -> point options: (only "TurnPoint x (1..4) times")
                - IMPORTANT: waypoint will have to be entered first to ensure HSI waypoint data is set up to select the HPTP from the HSI selection
                - explain to the user that specific harpoon stations can't be programmed and that the currently selected harpoon and any subsequent ones will be altered
                - special case, next point is target point if exists. get bra and range and display that info in data grid
                     - set that up as search range and destruct range +/- 15nmi (?)
     - A10C
         - remind user that selection MGRS will use MGRS input into CDU
             -fetch if UTM or L/L is selected (https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/2ao01d/so_apparently_there_was_a_way_to_get_the_text_of/)
                 - might be impossible, this is 9 years old
         - make sure waypoints with the same names get numbered
         - make sure that waypoint max name length is 12, even with the extra numbering
     - F15E
         - Ask user for seat
     - JF17 (?)
     - KA-50
         - Point types as per PVI-800
             - need to remember next point id for each type to press the correct button
     - F16
         - JDAM options(?)
add checkbox option for camera altitude/ground altitude in status bar
Allow users to do tedious setups, perhaps save a sequence of commands to be played back later
Make pressing N/S/E/W keys in the L/L textboxes switch the RB (on text change to allow pasting)
     - hitting the button should also switch to the next text box
make hitting the character limit in UTM and MGRS text boxes switch to the next text box
next waypoint bearing/range/deltaAltitude column
test if putting in text into combo boxes screws things up
