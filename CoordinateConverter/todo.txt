Unit list:
    - Filter by unit type/name
    - don't import units already in the wp list
        - ask user if they want to enable xfer if those units are xfer disabled
        - ask user if they want to push those units to the bottom of the list
        - ask user if they want to import those unit anyway or skip them

Execute:
    - ScintillaNET for code syntax highlighting and autocompletion
    - Load/Save scripts
    - common commands ddl?

Data Entry
    - Fix spurious data entry errors for AH64 KU

Waypoint list:
    - A point number field, showing where the point is in the aircraft's list
        - information only for some A/C where it can't be specifically picked (ex. AH64, F18C)
        - A/C where it can be picked, will enter points from there (JF17, F16C, KA-50)
        - if blank, auto increment
            - update when points are moved or removed
        - if invalid (past the last valid point):
            - display that and disable xfer checkbox
            - make sure that when points are removed/unchecked for xfer, that the checkbox gets enabled again
            - make sure to skip auto increment over non enabled xfer entries
            - make sure to skip disabled checkboxes when pressing space or clicking the header
    - Use data source instead of editing rows (see unit importer) for better performance and less maintenance

Add support for remote (DCS) hosts
    - auto switch reticle to never if ip is not localhost, because that makes no sense.

Make DataGridView faster
    - switch main form data grid to use a datatable (copy from unit importer)

rewrite networking
    - one stable connection, not constant connecting and disconnecting
    - lua should connect to the tool, not the tool to lua
        - prevents tool to hang without connections
        - binary property to check if connected before sending a message
    - lua creates socket in init
    - lua checks for connection every tick before trying to send/receive
    - lua autosends coordinates (?)
        - callback/delegate on data received?
        - async receiver
    - lua makes connection every x (3?) seconds using the timed export function if connection is not already established
        - dcs lag?
            - if so, how to make async?


Add support for F10 map selection selection instead of camera position when something is selected
    - add option for auto listing any new unit that was clicked
        - alternatively use LoGetWorldObjects("units") (Exports.lua:L426)
            - calculate every unit's distance from the camera ground position, if within a margin, add that unit if it isn't already in the list
            - exclude air units
            - use camera altitude (not ground elevation) to determine the margin
    - find out how to do that in lua
        - check in DCS World install dir in `\Scripts\Export.lua` for clues
        - LoGetObjectById()
            - how to get ID?


Add support for importing airfields
    - LoGetWorldObjects("airdromes") (Exports.lua:L426)
    - create coordinate data entries for each unit to import.
        - add the appropriate ah64 specific data for each unit type
        - use the dcs encyclopedia data to figure out categories for unknown types
        - load type database from external file?
            - tool to create/edit that file?
